The challenge was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it.

The users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
